# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Ticket Trader is a two-sided marketplace that lets season-ticket holders and casual fans exchange tickets for sports, concerts, and other live events instead of leaving them unused or overpaying on secondary sites. The platform provides **automated valuation**, **real-time matching**, and **secure settlement** that supports (a) direct like-value trades, (b) cash-balanced trades, and (c) inventory injected by the company to keep the market liquid.

## Scope & Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role / Interest |
| ----- | ----- |
| Season-Ticket Holder | Monetise or repurpose unused seats |
| Casual Fan | Acquire tickets for desired events at fair value |
| Platform Operations Team | Balance supply & demand; enforce policy & regulations |
| Payment Processor | Settle cash deltas and KYC/KYB users |
| Ticketing Partners (e.g., Ticketmaster) | Provide APIs for verification and transfer |
| Regulators / Compliance | Ensure BOTS Act, state resale, and consumer-protection compliance |
