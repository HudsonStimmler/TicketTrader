# **Ticket Trader – Final Requirements Specification (v1.0)**

---

## **1  Introduction**

Ticket Trader is a two‑sided marketplace that lets season‑ticket holders and casual fans exchange tickets for sports, concerts, and other live events instead of leaving them unused or overpaying on secondary sites. The platform provides **automated valuation**, **real‑time matching**, and **secure settlement** that supports (a) direct like‑value trades, (b) cash‑balanced trades, and (c) inventory injected by the company to keep the market liquid.

## **7  Assumptions & Constraints**

1. Commercial agreements with primary ticketing platforms will grant API access with defined rate limits.

2. Venues honour digital transfers executed via partner APIs.

3. The platform cannot guarantee value parity for every seat; valuation algorithm relies on historical and real‑time data.

4. Users must complete identity verification (KYC) before withdrawing funds.

5. Third‑party service outages (payment, ticketing API) may delay trade finalisation.
